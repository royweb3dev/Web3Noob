# Day 01 â€“ Semantic HTML Portfolio

This is the first milestone in my 413-day journey to become a Full Stack Web3 Developer.

## ðŸ“Œ What I Built

A clean, accessible static web page using only semantic HTML. No CSS, no JavaScript â€” just raw structure and meaning.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Practice HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Build the habit of structuring content with clarity and intention
- Set up the foundation for my Web3 portfolio layout

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

- The importance of meaningful markup (not just what it looks like)
- How to organize content for accessibility and SEO
- Basics of writing HTML thatâ€™s easy to read and extend

## ðŸ›  Tech Used

- HTML5 (only)

## ðŸš§ Next Up

Style this layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox on Day 09â€“10.
