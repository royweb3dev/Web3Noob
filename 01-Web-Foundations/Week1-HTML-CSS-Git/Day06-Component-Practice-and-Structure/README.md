### ‚úÖ Objectives Achieved

- Applied **modular CSS architecture** inside a single `styles.css` file using block-level comments.
- Extracted reusable utility classes:
  - `.btn`
  - `.mt-4`
  - `.shadow-md`
  - `.text-center`
- Cleanly separated layout zones into three primary areas:
  - `#skills` (Left Sidebar)
  - `#core` (Main Content)
  - `#projects` (Right Sidebar)
- Removed redundant CTA button (`Contact Me`) from the About section to maintain a cleaner UX.
- Maintained full compatibility with a two-file structure (`index.html` and `styles.css`) as required.
- Confirmed zero visual bugs and consistent responsive layout.
