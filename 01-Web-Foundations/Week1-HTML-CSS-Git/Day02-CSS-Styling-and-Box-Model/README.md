# Day 02 – CSS Styling & Layout Box Model

## ✅ What I Did

- Set up `styles.css` and linked it to my main `index.html`
- Applied global CSS reset with `box-sizing`, `margin`, and `padding`
- Defined base design system using `:root` for colors and fonts
- Built a 3-column layout (`#layout`) using CSS Grid
- Styled main sections: header, sidebar, main, footer
- Implemented collapsible skill and project sections using `<details>`
- Validated HTML (no trailing slash warnings, clean markup)

## 🔍 Focus

I focused on visual structure and consistency. I wanted the layout to feel clean and modern — not cluttered. Every block now has proper padding, border, background, and spacing. Text is readable on dark background. No inline styles. Everything is modular and scalable.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

- CSS Box Model behavior
- Importance of using a design system early
- How to avoid layout bugs with `min-width` and grid-gap
- Difference between Grid and Flexbox for structural layout

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` → Updated to semantic, valid HTML5
- `styles.css` → New styling file added

## 🚧 Next

I’ll start refining layout responsiveness, add hover effects, and experiment with better visuals for status labels.
