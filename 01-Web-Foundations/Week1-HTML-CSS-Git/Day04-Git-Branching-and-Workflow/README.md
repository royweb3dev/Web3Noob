## ðŸ§° Branching Strategy

| Branch Type   | Naming Convention      | Purpose                                 |
|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `main`        | `main`                 | Always production-ready and deployable  |
| `dev`         | `dev`                  | Integration branch for all features     |
| `feature/*`   | `feature/name`         | Isolated development of new features    |
| `bugfix/*`    | `bugfix/name`          | Minor bug resolutions                   |
| `hotfix/*`    | `hotfix/name`          | Emergency patches for production        |
